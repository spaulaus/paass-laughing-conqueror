## Disclaimer

## Introduction
I forked this software from [pixie16/paass](https://github.com/pixie16/paass). I was a developer on that project from 2009 - 2016. I gave the fork a new name to differentiate from the original software. PAASS - Laughing Conqueror or PAASS-LC combines my name with another developer's. 
 
Our development goals are
 
1. A modern scientific software package.
2. Acquisition and analysis test coverage to ensure accurate results. 
3. Provide an extensible framework to run experiments.

Software updates focus on 

1. Testing components
2. Performance enhancements
3. Documentation
4. UX

I made the decision not to focus on analysis of a single data set. I want to provide a software package that users can extend beyond a single experiment.

The software provides acquisition and analytis frameworks for the 
[XIA, LLC  DGF Pixie-16 modules](http://www.xia.com/DGF_Pixie-16.html). We write data in PLD or LDF formats. The software can interface with PACMAN for run control. This provides a stable and well debugged DAQ system. For more information visit the [wiki](https://github.com/spaulaus/paass-laughing-conqueror/wiki).
